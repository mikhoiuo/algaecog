# Made for my research class.
Should just count algae on a hemocytometer. Do whatever the hell you want with it.

To-do:
- actually get images
- train
- work
- web implementation xoxo
- maybe make it count calculate concentration but i kind of rlly dont want to do that

I don't know why you'd want to use this, but you can if you want.

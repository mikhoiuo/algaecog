# Made for my research class.
Should just count algae on a hemocytometer. Do whatever the hell you want with it. Needs OpenCV, Keras, scikit-learn, and numpy. Obligatory "I am a self-taught high schooler  with no common sense" warning for the code. Not done but I think the code is done.

To-do:
- actually get images
- train
- work
- organize + add notes to code
- web implementation xoxo
- maybe make it count calculate concentration but i kind of rlly dont want to do that

I don't know why you'd want to use this, but you can if you want.
